# Express.js Bootstrap Boilerplate

A simple boilerplate I made for personal use as a starting point for Express.js + Jade projects that use Bootstrap. Font Awesome has also been included because I find it quite handy to have. Quite handy for hackathons.

## Dependencies
### Pre-requisite
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)

### Installed via npm or included
* [Express.js](http://expressjs.com)
* [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)

## Usage
* Download a copy of the repository
  * I recommend not cloning the repository to avoid having to reconfigure git remotes. It's easier to just download a clean copy using the "Download ZIP" option to the right.
  * Alternatively, you can fork the repo, make your changes (e.g. rename) and then clone it to use as your own project repo.
* Install dependencies using npm  
`$ npm install`
* Run the app  
`$ node app.js`
* Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view your app

## Contributions
If you want to make any improvements to the boilerplate, feel free to fork the repo and then send me a pull request. I don't consider myself an Express expert by any means.
